### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
My actual name is Anton Shvedov, but you can call me Alan Reid. I'm a Frontend Developer, living in Moscow.

I've been around the Web for several years, first as a hobby, now struggling to turn it into a career. There have been victories and failures along the way, but all of them have given me a solid understanding that Frontend Development is my true passion.

I'd even say not only Frontend, but everything that correlates to computers drives me a lot and I'm eager to gain knowledge in these fields too.

### Why me?
My main shinning spot among many others is that I know what I want, why I want that and how to accomplish it.

### Skills
  - Responsive HTML/CSS
  - CSS preprocessors (LESS/SASS)
  - Javascript
  - Javascript Frameworks (React/Svelte)
  - Testing
  - Application design principles
  - MVC
  - Object-oriented programming (OOP)
