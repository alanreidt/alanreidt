### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
My actual name is Anton Shvedov, but you can call me Alan Reid. I'm a Frontend Developer, living in Moscow.

I've been around the Web for several years, first as a hobby, now struggling to turn it into a career. There have been victories and failures along the way, but all of them have given me a solid understanding that Frontend Development is my true passion.

I'd even say not only Frontend, but everything that correlates to computers drives me a lot and I'm eager to gain knowledge in these fields too.

### Why me?
My main shinning spot among many others is that I know what I want, why I want that and how to accomplish it. I've planned my future ~10 years ahead.

I'm not afraid of learning tools that will help to improve my work process, as same as different configuration processes, because I know it's part of a job, the job I like.

I always look for better ways, when I'm unsatisfied with anything. For example, React's one-way state architecture simplifies a mental overhead about state flow, but it violates integrity of a component. So, I want to find a solution for that.

### Skills
  - Responsive HTML/CSS
  - CSS preprocessors (LESS/SASS)
  - Javascript
  - Javascript Frameworks (React/Svelte)
  - Testing
